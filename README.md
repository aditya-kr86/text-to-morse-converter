# Text to Morse Code Converter

## 📝 Project Description
The **Text to Morse Code Converter** is a Python scripting project that translates English text into Morse code. This tool supports all English alphabets (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and spaces, making it ideal for learning, communication, or fun experiments with Morse code.

This project is part of the **Python Scripting** category and demonstrates how to use dictionaries, input handling, and string manipulation in Python.

## 🚀 Features
- Converts **English alphabets** (A-Z) and **numbers** (0-9) into Morse code.
- Supports **spaces**, which are represented by `/` in Morse code.
- **Handles invalid characters** gracefully by skipping and displaying a warning.
- **User-friendly output** with readable Morse code format.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`morse_converter.py`**: Main Python script containing the logic for the converter.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

No additional libraries are required. The script uses only Python's built-in modules.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-kr86/text-to-morse-converter.git
   cd text-to-morse-converter
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python morse_converter.py
   ```
3. Enter the text you want to convert into Morse code when prompted.

## 💻 Example Usage
### Input:
```
Hi I am Aditya kumar adityakr86
```

### Output:
```
Warning: Character '!' cannot be converted to Morse code. Skipping.

The Morse code for 'Hi I am Aditya kumar adityakr86' is:
.... .. / .. / .- -- / .- -.. .. - -.-- .- / -.- ..- -- .- .-. / .- -.. .. - -.-- .- -.- .-. ---.. -....
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Morse Code Dictionary**: The script uses a dictionary to map each character to its Morse code equivalent.
2. **Text Processing**: Each character in the user input is checked against the dictionary.
3. **Error Handling**: Unsupported characters are skipped, and a warning is displayed.
4. **Morse Code Conversion**: The valid characters are converted, with spaces represented as `/`.
